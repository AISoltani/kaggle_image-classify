The online cataloguing information is generated by subject matter experts and includes a wide range of data. These include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within The Met’s collection.
Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the ability to search for visually related objects.

## Experimentation

### install this tooling

A simple way how to use this basic functions:
```bash
! pip install https://github.com/Borda/kaggle_iMet-collection/archive/main.zip
```

### run notebooks in Kaggle

* [iMet Collection with Lightning ⚡](https://www.kaggle.com/jirkaborovec/imet-with-lightning)


### run notebooks in Colab

* [iMet Collection with Lightning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Borda/kaggle_iMet-collection/blob/main/notebooks/iMet-with-Lightning.ipynb)

I would recommend uploading the dataset to you personal gDrive and then in notebooks connect the gDrive which saves you lost of time with re-uploading dataset when ever your Colab is reset... :]

### some results

Training progress with ResNet50 with training  for 10 epochs and subset labels with ore then 10k samples:
