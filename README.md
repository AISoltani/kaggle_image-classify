Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards.
The current process for disease diagnosis in apple orchards is based on manual scouting by humans, which is time-consuming and expensive.

The main objective of the competition is to develop machine learning-based models to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify an individual disease from multiple disease symptoms on a single leaf image.
